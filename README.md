# A-Deep-Learning-Approach-to-Mango-Leaf-Disease-Detection

I developed a custom Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) for the purpose. It includes 16 layers: 5 convolutional layers, 5 max pool layers, 5 ReLU layers and 1 softmax activation layers.

This projet was supervised by Dr. Sifat Momen, Associate Professor, North South University, Dhaka, Bangladesh.
